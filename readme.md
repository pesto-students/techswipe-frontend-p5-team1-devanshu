# Technology Stack
We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Vite React Application](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)
- [React Hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- [React Select](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select)
